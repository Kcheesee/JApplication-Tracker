## 🎨 Customizing Your Icons (Optional)

Don't like the default "JT" icon? Here are options:

### Option 1: Use Favicon.io (Easy)
1. Go to [favicon.io/favicon-generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)
2. Create icon with:
   - Text: "Job" or briefcase emoji 💼
   - Background: #6366f1
   - Font: Bold
3. Download
4. Extract and use the PNG files

### Option 2: Use Flaticon (Professional)
1. Go to [flaticon.com](https://flaticon.com)
2. Search: "briefcase" or "job application"
3. Download PNG in 512x512
4. Resize to 192x192 for smaller icon
5. Place in `frontend/public/`

### Option 3: Design Your Own
Use Figma, Canva, or Photoshop to create:
- **192x192** PNG
- **512x512** PNG
- Recommended: Simple icon on colored background
- Use your brand colors!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
```
frontend/
├── index.html              # Added PWA meta tags
├── src/
│   └── main.tsx           # Added service worker registration
└── public/
    ├── manifest.json       # PWA configuration
    ├── sw.js              # Service worker
    ├── icon-192.png       # Small icon (you'll add)
    └── icon-512.png       # Large icon (you'll add)
```

### How It Works:

1. **manifest.json** tells the browser:
   - App name and description
   - Icon locations
   - Display mode (standalone = no browser UI)
   - Theme colors

2. **Service Worker (sw.js)** handles:
   - Caching static assets
   - Offline functionality
   - Fast loading from cache

3. **Meta tags** provide:
   - iOS installation support
   - Theme color for status bar
   - App title for home screen

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Install button doesn't appear"

**Check:**
1. Are you using HTTPS? (Render provides this ✓)
2. Do the icons exist in `frontend/public/`?
3. Is `manifest.json` accessible? Visit: `your-url.com/manifest.json`
4. Clear cache and hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify icons exist
ls frontend/public/icon-*.png

# Should show:
# icon-192.png
# icon-512.png
```

### "Service worker not registering"

**Check browser console** (F12 → Console):
- Should see: "✅ Service Worker registered successfully"
- If error, check `sw.js` is accessible: `your-url.com/sw.js`

### "Icons not showing"

Make sure icons are exactly:
- `icon-192.png` (lowercase, exact name)
- `icon-512.png` (lowercase, exact name)
- Located in `frontend/public/` (not in subdirectory)
