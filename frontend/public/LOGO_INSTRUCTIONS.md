# Logo Setup Instructions

Please save the logo image as `logo.png` in the `frontend/public/` directory.

The logo should be:
- Filename: `logo.png`
- Location: `frontend/public/logo.png`
- The image you provided (envelope with checkmark and calendar icon)

This will make it accessible at `/logo.png` in the deployed app.
